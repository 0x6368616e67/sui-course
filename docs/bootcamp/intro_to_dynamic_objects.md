On Wednesday, 8th March 2023 we were delighted to host the 'Intro to Dynamic Objects and Best Design Practices' workshop for our Encode x Sui Educate programme. This was the 4th of 6 events dedicated to educating hackers and non-technical people about Sui.
Huge thanks to Shayan Sanjideh for hosting this fantastic workshop!

The purpose of Encode x Sui partnership is to educate people about Sui and get them building! As we go on, these live educational events will be converted into dedicated online learning resources for future learners to study in their own time.
