On Wednesday, 8th January 2023 we were delighted to host the 'What‚Äôs Sui? General Overview and Introduction to Sui Network' workshop for our Encode x Sui Educate programme. This was the first of six events dedicated to educating hackers and non-technical people about Sui.

Huge thanks to Shayan Sanjideh for hosting this fantastic workshop!

Correction regarding latency @ 00:07:27
Sui achieves lower latency by bypassing consensus in favor of Byzantine consistent broadcast. By decoupling transaction dissemination from consensus, Sui achieves much greater throughput

The purpose of Encode x Sui partnership is to educate people about Sui and get them building! As we go on, these live educational events will be converted into dedicated online learning resources for future learners to study in their own time.
